## Overview

AutoSharePolling is a modern ride-booking application built using the MERN stack. Inspired by the popular service Rapido, this app allows users to book rides easily. Users can view their ride history, while drivers can accept and complete rides efficiently. The app is designed with a user-friendly interface that enhances the experience for both riders and drivers.

## Features

- **Real-time Vehicle Selection**: Users can see available vehicles in real-time.
- **Location Autocomplete**: Start typing your location, and the app will suggest options.
- **Fare Calculation**: Get an estimate of your ride fare before booking.
- **Ride History**: View all your past rides and their details.
- **Driver Acceptance**: Drivers can easily accept ride requests.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.

AutoSharePolling uses the following technologies:

- **Frontend**:
